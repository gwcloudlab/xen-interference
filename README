PROJECT TITLE: Xen Interference Minimizing Scheduler
TEAM MEMBERS: Wei Zhang, Sunny Rajasekran
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

This version of Xen has a modified Credit scheduler that supports 
"batch" priority VMs. Any VM that is given a weight of 0 will only
be scheduled if there is no other runnable VCPU with higher priority.

xl sched-credit -d domid -w 0

The scheduler also can report more statistics about how VCPUs are 
scheduled, including the number of scheduling intervals at each
priority level, and the amount of time spent running, blocked, etc.

xl vcpu-stat: reports scheduler statistics for all VMs


---
This is a version of Xen 4.2.1 that has been configured so it can
run inside a VMware VM running Ubuntu 12.04 and Linux 3.7.
I'm not sure if I changed anything other than the .config file.
